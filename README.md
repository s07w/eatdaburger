## What the App Does

The app allows the user to add, devour, and review previously devoured burgers. 

## App functionality and challenges

The app uses JawsDB and Heroku deployment. The table of burgers is updated through an ORM/ORM model and templated out in Handlebars. It also uses scripts for routing config and a controller script for the GET, POST, and PUT requests. 

The challenges in this project were legion. Getting each component to work, as well as the initial wrestling with the Handlebars syntax/logic was very frustrating. Fortunately, deployment to Heroku through the use of JawsDB was blessedly problem free. Close care to making sure there were zero typos, consistent invocation, and correct use of 'req' and 'res' was integral in getting the app up and working. This was an excellent introduction to the many challenges present in getting even a simple app up and running.
